/*
Intro 
  We are starting a small community of users.
For performance reasons, we have decided to store all users right in the code. 
This way we can provide our developers with mor user-interaction opportunities. 
With user-related data, at least. All the GDPR-related issues will be solved some other day.
This would be the basis for our future experiments during these exercises.

Exercise:
  Given the data, define the interface "User" and use it accordingly.

    age: 23,
